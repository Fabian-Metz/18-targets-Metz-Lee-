The goal of this R Markdown report is to display and explain the results of our machine learning models. Visit <https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2018-01-11-keras-customer-churn/> for background and context.

# Model accuracy.

Here is the accuracy from our model with the relu activation function in the first layer.

```{r}
library(targets)
tar_read(run_relu)
```

Here is the accuracy from our model with the sigmoid activation function in the first layer.

```{r}
tar_load(run_sigmoid)
run_sigmoid
```

# Best model

Your turn: write an R code chunk that prints the `best_model` target.
