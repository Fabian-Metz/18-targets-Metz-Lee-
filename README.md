# Establishing pipelines with targets

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents
In this workshop will cover how to:

- build a pipeline of custom functions using  `tar_script()` , `tar_edit()`and `tar_target()`
- visualize dependencies using `tar_visnetwork()` & `tar_manifest()`
- run your pipeline using  `tar_make()`
- check for outdated targets using `tar_outdated()`
- access targets to work with them using `tar_read()`and  `tar_load()`




### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) illustrate a workflow of creating reproduciable pipelines of custom functions, (2) introduce you to the key verbs and convetions of using the targets pacakge, 
and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
